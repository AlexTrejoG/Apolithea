## Overview
### Description
**Apolithea** is a music therapy app. It matches users to music based on their current mood. This is to help with the physical, pyschological, and social well being of individuals.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Lifestyle/Music
- **Mobile:** **Apolithea** is an app primarily designed for mobile, though if used on other platforms, it may lose some features.
- **Story:** **Apolithea** will match the users current emotion(s) to playlist. The user will then be able to "vibe" to music that aligns with said emotion.
- **Market:** This app can used by all ages. 
- **Habit:** This app can be used whenever. In the moments where the user does not know what to listen to, but they know what mood they are in whether it be sad, happy, angry, etc., the app is just a convinent way to listen to music that currently matches the users current mood.
- **Scope:** We would first start by asking what kinds of music that person likes. Then, ask the users emotion and match said emotion to music within the ranges of the type of music the user likes. This gives the user a chance to discover music as well.
